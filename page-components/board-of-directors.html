                <p>Cindy is one of the founders of Toledo's PET Bull Project. She works tirelessly to keep all the programs running smoothly and create new experiences for our community. Cindy had a dog she got from a puppy mill at 10 weeks old who had never been outside. His pads were swollen from sitting in his own feces and urine. This was back in 2009 when puppy mills were not as well-known and widespread as they are today. At 5 months old he began to chase his tail excessively and aggressively at times. When she took him to the vet, they said he would never get better, and he should be euthanized. Cindy wanted to know more about this condition called "Spinning" which is an obsessive-compulsive disorder. She did research and found Dr. Alice Moon at Tufts University who specialized in this disorder. Together with the local veterinarian they came up with a plan to properly manage his issues. Cindy felt that if she could do this research and educate herself to help her dogs then others could as well.</p>

She always wanted to volunteer within her community and when she learned there was a group saving dogs and educating humans, she was in. Ann and her beloved pitbull Neo taught humane education at the Adult Treatment Center, in local schools, parks and libraries for over 10 years. Her most memorable moment is teaching a humane education class to a known dog fighter who was incarcerated. Neo and Ann walked in the Old West End parade many times. Ann and Cindy lobbied against breed specific legislation in Columbus. She continues Pawsitive Reading programs with her pitbull mix, Rosie. She joined the PET Bull board in 2025, bringing her passion for pittties and her event experience to TPBP.

                <p>Ellen became involved in Toledo's PET Bull Project in 2023. She grew up in Toledo and has also called Atlanta, Georgia, and Lusaka, Zambia home. In 2013, she adopted her first and only dog, Buckeye, who has been by her side through each of those moves. Buckeye wasn't always the easiest dog, but she taught Ellen one of the most important lessons about rescue: every dog can adapt when given patience, guidance, and an owner willing to put in the effort. That experience shaped Ellen's deep appreciation for rescue organizations and the vital role they play in giving dogs and families a second chance.</p>
                <p>Today, Ellen serves on the Board of Toledo Petbull Project as webmaster and helps coordinate training class registrations, along with pitching in wherever she's needed. She is proud to support TPP's mission and believes that rescue is about more than saving lives — it's about building stronger connections between people, dogs, and the community.</p>
